# Aurelia-form

[View on github](https://github.com/spoonx/aurelia-form)

Almost all interactive applications contain forms. A lot of applications, like dashboards, contain many forms. This repetitive, mind-numbing process of writing forms is something that motivated us to write a plugin to do the work for us, and you.

Aurelia is a great tool for generating forms, as it provides a lot of useful utilities and plugins to do so. What Aurelia form does, is leverage Aurelia's strengths, and create a standardized way of describing forms simply using objects and arrays.

Some of the features this plugin provides include:

- multi css-framework support ([is your framework missing](https://github.com/SpoonX/aurelia-form/tree/master/src/component/framework)? Submit a PR!)
- [aurelia-orm](aurelia-orm.spoonx.org) support (forms based on entity definition, no need to make a schema)
- validation
- concise way of describing forms using schemas
- easy override and extending of forms
- helpers for individual components, for forms with a special need
- generate forms programmatically
