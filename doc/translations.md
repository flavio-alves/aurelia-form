# Translations

Aurelia-form uses aurelia-i18n to perform translations.

Translation will not work if aurelia-i18n is not setup with the `t` attribute
as the translating attribute.

Aurelia-form provides aurelia-i18n with first the label and otherwise the key
property defined on the element's object.

You can read more about adding translatins to your project at
[aurelia-i18n](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n).
