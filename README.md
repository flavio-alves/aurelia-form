> This library is a plugin for the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform.

Makes working with forms just a tad more pleasant.

- A standardized schema for describing forms
- Elements for generating forms with two way databinding by default
- Support for multiple css frameworks enabled by view manager
- Ability to define your own custom elements and overwrite the default elements
- Aliases for types so you can reuse elements for similar or different types
- A descent amount of types so you can start generating forms out of the box
